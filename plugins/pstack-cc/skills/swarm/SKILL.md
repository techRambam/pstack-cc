# Swarm

Fan out N parallel cloud workers. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers, not the cloud concurrency limit.
4. Pick the worker model from the `swarm workers` line in `~/.claude/pstack-models.md`. If the rule or that line is missing, use `sonnet`. For `auto` or `inherit-parent`, omit `model` so the workers run on the parent model. If the Agent tool rejects a slug, use the default and say so. If it rejects the default, use the closest valid slug of the same family from its error message. For a model race, name each arm's model up front.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one message with `subagent_type: general-purpose`, `isolation: "worktree"`, `run_in_background: true`, and the step 4 model, left unset for `auto` or `inherit-parent`. Use `environment: "local"` only when the worker needs access to something on the user's computer.

When a worker must start from a non-default pushed branch, name the branch in its brief so it checks that branch out first.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.

## Cross-vendor panelists

This skill's value comes from **model diversity, not personas**. Claude Code's
`Agent` tool reaches Anthropic models only, so a panel built purely from it is
one family wearing different hats — weaker than what this skill assumes.

Use both dispatch routes in the same panel, in parallel:

- **Anthropic seats** → the `Agent` tool with `model:` set to `opus`, `fable`,
  `sonnet` or `haiku`. Never route these through `panelist`. A seat that only reviews
  or judges uses `subagent_type: "pstack-cc:read-only"`, so it cannot edit the tree or
  spawn a fan-out of its own; a seat that writes a candidate keeps `general-purpose`.
- **Other-vendor seats** → Bash, one call per seat:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/panelist run -m gpt-5.6-sol -p /tmp/seat-a.md --schema /tmp/verdict.json
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/panelist run -m gemini-3-flash-preview -p /tmp/seat-b.md --schema /tmp/verdict.json
```

A `gpt-*`, `gemini-*` or `vendor:model` entry in a model line or a default table
is one of these seats; never pass it to the `Agent` tool's `model`. A seat that must
produce a candidate (an arena runner) returns it as a unified diff or whole files
in its answer, and you write that into the candidate's slot.

Write the seat's prompt to a file and pass `-p`; write one plain JSON Schema and
pass the same `--schema` file to every seat. `panelist` converts it per vendor
(OpenAI strict mode and Gemini's OpenAPI subset disagree about `required` and
`additionalProperties`, so one file cannot satisfy both raw).

`panelist doctor` lists which models answer right now. Reachable today: OpenAI
via the org `codex` CLI (`gpt-6-astra`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-luna`,
`gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.5`), or via `OPENAI_API_KEY` where `codex` is absent (a
cloud session), and Google's free tier (`gemini-3-flash-preview`,
`gemini-3.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`). Gemini **pro**
returns HTTP 429 — free tier is flash-class only, so weight a Gemini seat
accordingly rather than treating it as a peer of an Opus seat.

A fourth route is wired but unkeyed: **OpenRouter**, which reaches many model
*families* through one key (DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, Nemotron, Gemma, Cohere — 22
free-tier models). Every currently-reachable seat is a GPT, a Gemini or a
Claude, so OpenRouter is where genuinely different architecture would come from.
If `panelist doctor` says NO KEY, note in your verdict table that the panel is
three-vendor rather than four, and carry on.

Seats are read-only by construction: `panelist` runs `codex exec -s read-only`
and Gemini has no tool access at all. A panelist reviews and reports; it never
edits the tree.

Run each seat's Bash call with `run_in_background: true` when it may take more than a few
minutes. A foreground call is killed at 600s, and `panelist`'s own default timeout (540s)
sits just under that so a slow seat reports "timed out" instead of vanishing. Pass `-t` for
longer seats.

**A seat counts only if it delivered.** That means exit status 0, a non-empty
answer, and (under `--schema`) JSON that parses against the schema. Anything else
is a **dropout**: name the seat, its model and the error in the verdict table, and
carry on with the seats you have. Never substitute another model for a dropout
silently, and never let one model fill two seats to keep the count up, because
the panel exists for model diversity. A panel of three that names its missing
fourth is honest; reporting three as if four voted is not.
